# Project My_Tutor

This project was created as a practice exercise for RRF-Batch-2025. It showcases my use of HTML, Tailwind CSS, and jQuery to develop a fully responsive website. 

By leveraging Tailwindâ€™s responsive utility classes, I ensured the design adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - For structuring the content and layout of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework used for efficient and responsive styling. Also used the Tailwind CLI, installed via npm, to enable custom configuration and efficient CSS compilation.
- **Jquery** - Implemented to add interactivity and dynamic functionality.
